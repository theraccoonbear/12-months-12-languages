# Resources

The following are resources to help you learn and provide you with ideas for programming challenges.

 * *[CodeGolf StackExchange](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)* - [Code Golf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is a generic term for programming problems (some trivial, some not) where the goal is not just to solve a problem, but to do so with the fewest lines or bytes ("strokes" in code golf).

 * *[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)* - A large set of math related coding challenges.

 * *[OBS<sub>c</sub>](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/11/17x17-challenge-worth-28900-this-is-not.html)* - A set of challenges relating to coloring grids of grids such that you obstruct the creation of rectangles with the same colors at each corner.  Smaller grids can be brute forced, larger grids require something more sophisticated.
